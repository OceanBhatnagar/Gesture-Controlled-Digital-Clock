# Gesture Controlled Digital Clock

Welcome to the Gesture Controlled Digital Clock project repository!
This project features a digital clock displayed on a 16x2 I2C LCD screen, with settings such as time and date adjustments performed wirelessly using IR sensors.
The Arduino Uno microcontroller is used to facilitate these functionalities.

## Components Used
- **Arduino Uno**
- **3 IR Sensors**
- **16x2 I2C LCD Screen**
- **Breadboard**
- **Jumper Wires**

## Software
- **Arduino IDE**: Used for writing, compiling, and uploading code to the Arduino Uno.
  - Libraries used:
    - `Wire.h`: Enables I2C communication for the LCD screen.
    - `LiquidCrystal_I2C.h`: Provides functions to control the 16x2 I2C LCD screen.

## Project Structure
- **Code**: Arduino code responsible for displaying the digital clock on the LCD screen and handling gesture inputs from IR sensors.
- **Project Photographs**: Images showing the setup of components and interactions.
- **Schematics**: Circuit diagram illustrating how the Arduino Uno, IR sensors, and LCD screen are connected.
- **TinkerCAD Diagram**: A visual representation of the circuit in TinkerCAD.
